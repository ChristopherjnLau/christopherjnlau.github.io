Halo has been an amazing game experience and was actually one of my first. I was exposed to console games unless I went to my cousin's house and back then I was afraid to play games like this. But now it is still one of my favorite franchises and I hope it will continue to live on.

What I love to on xbox is collect achievements. Halo achievements are even better to get because of the fun and/or challenge. Ever since the Master Chief Collection came out, I started collecting more achievements. Even today, I still try to collect them. The most difficult achievements would probably be doing Mythic or LASO (Legendary all skulls on) mode and completing campaigns in under 3 hours on legendary (hard difficulty in the game).
