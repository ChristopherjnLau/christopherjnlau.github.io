We created a game where you play as a ninja cat that runs through a level to try to find its baby cat. The cat has to avoid enemies and the game has real life physics like gravity. We used object oriented programming, file reading, and user interface. The team consisted of Brian-Mario Olivarez, John Ampa, Christian Ramelb, and myself.
