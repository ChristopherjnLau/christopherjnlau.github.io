I have never had a job until June 25th, 2018. I applied to at least 9 different locations including Shirokiya. I just never knew it would be so hard to find a job. I got turned down by some places or they never even responded to my application. When my boss Sandy called, I did everything the same, we set up an interview with her and Blake (another boss) and I hoped for the best. I was wearing an aloha t shirt with dress pants so I don't think I was prepared that well. When the interview started it was not like other interviews. Instead of asking questions like, "how will you improve this company?" they just asked about my resume and availability. Which is good because I didn't do so well talking. But I got the job and I was extremely grateful for it.

At Shirokiya, I work as a dishwasher. So I don't work for any of the vendors but I help the bars by cleaning their glassware. Usually in a days work we go out collect glasses or wait for the Janiking (Janitors) to bring it in for us. Then we clean and give it to the bars. My first days were brutal because I wasn't use to standing for 6+ hours. The pain was real but I got use to it soon. My co-workers are really good, no problems, they help a lot, and they all seem like really good people. It is a very simple job but I find it kind of fun. Sure, it is a little physically demanding but I love doing simple tasks that help people out. I actually prefer working to relieve the stress I deal with in life. Overall, my first working experience is better than I had expected and I hope to continuce working here for at least 2 years.
