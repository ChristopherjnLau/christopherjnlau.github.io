Javascript seems like a nice language for a software engineer. They have functions or different types of actions you can do that other languages can't such as iterating through objects. Compared to Java it seems pretty much the same except a little bit cleaner. Everyhing looks nicer and you don't have to create a class just to run simple code. It does seem a little harder to debug due to the console but maybe thats just me. The pratice WODs were easy because you don't have the pressure of losing points. The practice WODs were a great way to practice and learn while the first WOD killed me. I was able to do it all but there was one small error that did not allow me to finish because I spent like 5 minutes trying to debug. For the blackjack, if your hand equals 21 and the opponent's hand is less than 21, you win. But I left out an equal sign when writing that code (which will be on here soon). Plus there is so much more pressure when you see others finish so early. Overall, I am not having such a good experience with Javascript but I will continue to practice it and then maybe I will love it. And as both professors said, we need to put in time.
