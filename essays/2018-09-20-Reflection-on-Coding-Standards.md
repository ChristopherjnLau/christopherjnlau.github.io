Many things have standards, whether it be a professional kitchen, school test, or even the clothes you buy in a mall. They all need to be at a certain degree of quality. I love Gordon Ramsay and his TV programs like [Hell's Kitchen](https://www.fox.com/hells-kitchen/) or [MasterChef](https://www.fox.com/masterchef/) and one thing he really stresses about is standards. For example, if a chef gives Ramsay bad food he gets upset and make them do it over again because it is just not up to par with what he wants. Amazingly, coding does have the exact same standards! If you write poor code, other people won't be able to read or understand it. Therefore, either you or they would have to revise it until it is acceptable (which is a time consuming and stressful process, from my experience). If you wrote bad code for your boss or a customer and it doesn't do what they want, then you will face some terrible consequences. Luckily, I am currently taking ICS 212 at UH Manoa and that class teaches us how to format code better. And it taught me one crucial life lesson, the computer is always right. The computer doesn't write the bad code it just reads it because computers are dumb and we have to tell them everything step by step, specifically. Otherwise, you get an error and you have to go through the painful process of editing. Overall, coding standards are pretty important being for any programmer.

I have had an okay to good experience with ESLint. It is great for catching errors but sometimes the errors don't even effect how the code compiles. For example, ESLint will give errors for having an extra line at the end of your code. Small errors like that will prevent your code being able to run. But, it has sort of taught me how to format a little better. Like making a variable that you don't use, having unnecessary spaces, and needing spaces at certain points. To me, the code using ESLint is a lot easier to read than the code I made in JSFiddle at the beginning of this class. Within the last week, ESLint has forced me to write code in a way so that it continuously gives me the green checkmark :). To summarize everything, standards are extremely important when doing anything to make everyone's life easier but more importantly to help people grow into a better individual.
